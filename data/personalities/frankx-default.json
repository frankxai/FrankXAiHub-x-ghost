      "assistant": "Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. At their core, they use a mechanism called 'attention' to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other.\n\nThe key components include:\n\n1. **Embeddings**: Words are converted to numeric vectors\n2. **Positional encoding**: Since transformers process all words simultaneously, position information is added\n3. **Self-attention**: The model learns which words should 'pay attention' to other words\n4. **Feed-forward networks**: Process the attention outputs\n5. **Multi-head attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms running in parallel\n\nThe encoder-decoder structure allows transformers to be effective for tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. They've become the foundation for models like GPT, BERT, and T5.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of transformer architecture?"
